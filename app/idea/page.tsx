      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mb-8">
        Students spend hours organizing notes, creating study materials, and finding study partners,
        often feeling overwhelmed and unprepared for exams. Traditional studying is isolated,
        passive, and time-consuming â€” we aim to change that.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">The Problem</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
        <li>Creating flashcards manually is tedious and time-consuming</li>
        <li>Hard to extract key concepts from lengthy lecture slides</li>
        <li>Studying alone is boring and unmotivating</li>
        <li>No easy way to test knowledge or track progress</li>
        <li>Finding study partners with similar material is difficult</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-3">The Solution</h2>
